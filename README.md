# United States Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (USEEIO) Modeling Framework 
A modeling framework for creating versions of the USEEIO model for estimating potential impacts of goods and services in the US economy in approximately 400 categories. This framework supports the Sustainable Materials Management program at US EPA (www.epa.gov/smm), but may also be useful for other purposes. It is built using a technique from life cycle assessment (LCA) that combines industry economic data with data on environmental releases and resources used.  A background and description of USEEIO can be found in the following publication:
